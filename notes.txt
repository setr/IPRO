Building a decision system

1. Questions
    a. Convert possible answers into a metric
    b. Add Questions to graph
        i. Ideally, easy to add/remove (parses a txt file)
2. Apply metric to graph, come out with answer
    a. Maybe shade decision paths?
    b. Maybe note possible other problems associated with current ones.
3. Toss out the answer.


This would all be encased in a not awful GUI
probably questions with selectable answers in a table
