# IPRO Code

## Particle_Code
dashboard.particle.io

Just shove it onto a particle photon, correct the analog inputs, and it should log everything to your account's particle dashboard. 

## Question_Set
    
questionset.txt is just the skeleton java class & instantiation code for the GUI implementation. Passed it off to Yalinne and she took care of the rest (wrapped in the GUI, with buttons and logic and whatnot).

The question tree is from Bryan and Kevin's work.

## Streaming_Graph

Streams data to plot.ly for graphing, on multiple subgraphs.

Currently working with generated test data, tested from 1 to 4 streams.

Needs to be changed to stream code in from dashboard.particle.io, and forward that to plot.ly
