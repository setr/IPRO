#Streaming Graphs

Streaming_graph.py is the main code. It streams data in from the dashboard.particle.io logs, and parses it, repackages it, and then streams it out to plot.ly for graphing (and webhosting)

Streamer.py is just an example of the core code necessary to stream in data from dashboard.particle.io
